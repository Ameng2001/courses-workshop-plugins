## Domain Experts

3 built-in agents in each plugin's `agents/` directory:
- **early-childhood-curriculum-expert** — PBL methodology, curriculum standards, age-appropriateness
- **child-development-psychologist** — developmental stages, 4C mapping, prior knowledge
- **instructional-designer** — activity feasibility, resource planning, teacher instructions

## Development Workflow

1. Edit SKILL.md files directly — changes take effect immediately
2. Test with: `claude --plugin-dir ./workshop-core --plugin-dir ./workshop-designer --plugin-dir ./workshop-insight --plugin-dir ./workshop-quality --plugin-dir ./workshop-resource`
3. Key test flow: `/workshop-designer:design 我周围的人`
