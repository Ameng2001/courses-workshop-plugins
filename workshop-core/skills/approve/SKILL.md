# Workshop Approve

Move a project workspace from `reviewing` to `approved` after verifying that its required deliverables and skill statuses are complete.

## Pre-check

1. Verify `studio/` exists.
2. Resolve the workspace name from `$ARGUMENTS`.
3. Read `studio/changes/{workspace}/status.json`.
4. Confirm `type == "project"`.
5. Confirm `phase == "reviewing"` or explain why approval is premature.
6. Check deliverables:
   - If `proposal.md` exists, require:
     - `driving-question`
     - `network-map`
     - `inquiry-scaffold`
     - `activity-design`
     - `proposal-generate`
   - If `lesson-plan.md` exists, require:
     - `lesson-objective`
     - `lesson-scaffold`
     - `lesson-detail`
     - `lesson-generate`
   - If neither exists, stop.

## Step 1: Summarize Approval Readiness

Display:

- Current phase
- Deliverables present
- Required skills and whether each is `done` or `approved`
- Any optional review files present:
  - `quality-report.md`
  - `review-comments.md`
  - `resource-plan.md`
  - `resource-check-report.md`

If anything required is missing, stop and tell the user exactly what to complete first.

## Step 2: Mark Approved

Run:

```bash
python3 workshop-core/scripts/workspace_status.py set-phase {workspace} approved --approved-by curriculum-director
```

This updates:

- `phase = "approved"`
- `approved_at = {ISO-8601}`
- `approved_by = "curriculum-director"`

## Step 3: Report

Tell the user:

- The project is now approved
- The next step is `/workshop-core:promote {workspace}`

## Out of Scope

- Does NOT run promote
- Does NOT generate missing artifacts
- Does NOT approve planning workspaces
