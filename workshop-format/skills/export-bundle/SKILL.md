# Export Bundle

Prepare a delivery-oriented export bundle without altering the runtime source-of-truth files.

## Pre-check

1. If the workspace is active, read `.workshop/projects/{workspace}/status.json`
2. If the workspace is archived, read `.workshop/archive/{archive}/status.json`
3. Read `docs/release-bundle-model.md`
4. Read `workshop-format/references/export-targets.md`

## Step 1: Determine Source

Prefer the following source files when present:

- `lesson-plan.formatted.md`
- `lesson-plan.md`
- `proposal.md`
- `resource-plan.md`
- `quality-report.md`
- `review-comments.md`
- `resource-check-report.md`

If a formatted source exists, use it as the export input.

## Step 2: Select Export Target

Supported target modes:

- `local-markdown-bundle`
- `word-ready-bundle`
- `pdf-ready-bundle`
- `remote-bundle-placeholder`

Default:
- `local-markdown-bundle`

## Step 3: Prepare Export Directory

Write into a delivery-oriented directory under:

- `.workshop/exports/{workspace}/`

Include:
- `manifest.yaml`
- exported markdown sources
- optional assets placeholder directory

## Step 4: Preserve Release Semantics

Do not move or delete:
- `.workshop/projects/*`
- `.workshop/archive/*`
- `courses/*`

This skill is additive. It prepares export packaging, but does not replace `promote`.

## Step 5: Report

Return:
- export target mode
- output path
- next recommended step

## Out of Scope

- This skill does NOT render real `.docx` or `.pdf` files yet
- It does NOT publish to COS/S3 directly
- It does NOT change project approval status
